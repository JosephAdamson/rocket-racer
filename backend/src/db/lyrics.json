Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack. Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack. Realized I forgot to call you back. Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap. Stan, Stan, son. Listen, man, Dad isn't mad. But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun. And have a man-bun? The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable. Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked. Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me. I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze. Your reply got the crowd yelling, \"Woo!\". So before you die let's see who can out-petty who. With your corny lines (\"Slim, you're old\")—ow, Kelly, ooh. But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you. By 29, I had three albums that had blew. Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do. Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food. But you're a fuckin' mole hill. Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo! Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow. Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow. Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt). Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up). Are you eating cereal or oatmeal? What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios? 'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material. …Dictionary…. \"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked. Go back to Recovery,\" oh shoot, that was three albums ago. What do you know? Oops. Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof. Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02. To burn it in front of you, ho. Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true. I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you. 'Til I'm hitting old age. Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage. Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play. Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay. Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day. Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave. Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat. You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay. Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow. Kelly, they'll be putting your name. Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker! Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain. Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah). My biggest flops are your greatest hits. The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks. So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss. Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?). Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait. In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name. Now I gotta cock back, aim. Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop). It's your moment. This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it. Had to give you a career to destroy it. Lethal injection. Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort. But if I was three-foot-eleven. You'd look up to me, and for the record. You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second. Lick a ballsack to get on my channel. Give your life to be as solidified. This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets. So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo? Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper. How the fuck can him and I battle? He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel. I'll give him my sandals. 'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow. Exhausting, letting off on my offspring. Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me! You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see. You're fuckin' salty. 'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey. Your red sweater, your black leather. You dress better, I rap better. That a death threat or a love letter? Little white toothpick. Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick. Thanks for dissing me. Now I had an excuse on the mic to write \"Not Alike\". But really I don't care who's in the right. But you're losin' the fight you picked. Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's! Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle. Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still. But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills. But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits. That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah! I'm sick of you bein' wack. And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune. So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it). I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth. Need to get the cock up out it. Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it). I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings. Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think. That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers). Don't mean you are, and you're not about it. So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it.",

Opinions over statistics, of course. Gassed off journalistic. Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report. Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork. I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course. At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course. Girls huggin' me then askin' me, \"What scent that is, boy?\". I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy. Yeah, who am I? The do or die. The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties. They try to compare us, but. Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I. I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride. All factual, I call the house \"the embassy\". The studio \"the chapel\", I hate to travel. I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural. I knew her way back when Hollywood was international. Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends. Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz. Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential. I broke spirits that I never meant to. My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine. And sleep at the opposite times. Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil. Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil. Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles. Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I. I refuse to comply with regulations. I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence. Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions. Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya. Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license. They tell me \"don't worry, I got your money\" like Osirus. (I'm the Osiris of this shit). Dirty 30, workin' on me. Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry. Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite. Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo. Calamari rings and tomato. I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo. Wakin' up at 6 PM like, \"Where does the day go?\". Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables. 2010 was when I lost my halo. 2017 I lost a J. Lo. A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though. I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes. Closed off but I could never stay closed. Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños. Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie. That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't. Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy. Protection that God gave me. Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies. I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages. I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers. Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here. Cover my ears. , my security government tier. Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits. Check the guest list. If opps make an appearance at least it's expected. Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace. I'll be in better company with my own reflection. Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace. The TV playin' Al Jazeera. Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer. Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira.",

And really didn't sleep much last night (Last night). \"I'm sorry,\" that's fine. I just think I need a little me time. I just think I need a little free time. Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah (Bus rides). Last year I had a breakdown. Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud. Had to see a therapist, then I found out. Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house. Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out. You know, pack my cart, take a new route. Clean up my yard, get the noose out. Hang up my heart, let it air out (Air out). I’ve been searchin'. \"What does that mean, Nate?\" I've been learning. Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin’ my burdens. Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect. Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me. Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous. Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry. And things might hurt me. It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (But hey). It's worth it, though. Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats. It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam. Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code. Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode. Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone. Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes. I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?). Been makin' a whole lot of changes. Wrote a song about that, you should play it. I get scared when I walk on these stages. I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah. That's when I start to get anxious. That's when my thoughts can be dangerous. That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred. Forget what I'm sayin', and—. Where'd the beat go? Oh, ain't that somethin'? Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'. Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'. Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach. Throw it back up like I don't want it. Wipe my face, clean off my vomit. OCD, tryna push my buttons. I said don't touch it, now y'all done it. I can be critical, never typical. Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal. Intimate, but never political, pretty visual. Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though. You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable. Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool. Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful. Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos, videos). Yeah, the sales can rise. Doesn't mean much though when your health declines. See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside. That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies. Try to hold it underwater but it always survives. Then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise. Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies. You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am. The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place. And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way. It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe. Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay? Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face. Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great. You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate. Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith, woo. I've been developin', take a look at the benefits. Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate. Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it. Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence. Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative. I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine. Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip. Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (Ah). It's that time again. Better grab your balloons and invite your friends. Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in. Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big. On a road right now that I can't predict. Tell me \"Tone that down,\" but I can't resist. Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist. The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh.",

I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside. If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers at Burger King. Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me? In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that? If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back? Now we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap. And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that).",

On some ground ball shit. ‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit. They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch. Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather. G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather. Champagne just tastes better. They told me I never, boy, never say never. Swear flow special like an infant's first steps. I got paid then reversed debts. Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress. So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death. Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride.

We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody. Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody. I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot. The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic. And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas. Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot. I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop. Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'. And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs. ‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG. So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar. Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me. Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet. Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats. Clique so deep we take up the whole street.

Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake. Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller. I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas. Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas. They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas. What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high. Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive. Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand. With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land. With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg.

That Lambo' my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost. I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast. 'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home. 'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk. These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed. You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked. 'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no. All I know is murder, when it come to me. I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's. I done did the DOA's,. I done did the KOD's. Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's. But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (Skrrt). They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (Let's go). We young niggas, we mobbin' (Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (Whoa). This two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'. I'm like, \"Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?\". If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up! If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up. When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good. Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood. With that Puma life on my feet\nlike that little engine I could. Boy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on 12 o'clock (Rah). And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly). And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots. And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped. I'm the same nigga from Berks Street\nwith them nappy braids, that lock. The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot. And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me. Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E. They gon' remember me, I say remember me. So much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies. And when there’s beef, I turn my enemies to memories. With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key. Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch. And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick? It was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist. Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick. I'm gone. Woo!.",

Estoy muy lejos de casa pero cerca del millón. Todo' eso rapper' hablan pero ¿quién carajo son? Hijo de mil puta, ¿cuándo escribieron la canción? No sé si tienen razón, no sé si son mi son. No sé si tienen voces, ¿você sabe quiénes son? Yo nunca los vi, no te ven ahí. Manito, sabe' que yo lo hago así. Yo soy un perro, vos sos un wannabe. Yo lo hago así, gano porque sí. Porque tengo flow, porque tengo free. Porque tengo hits, porque tengo mil. Ideas pa' matar a un gil, pero con rimas y con skills. Para darle en la face, darle de nuevo y poner play. Oh my God, haciendo todo lo que quiero adentro del game. El manín me da replay, como digo yo, \"what you gonna say?\". Esos rapper' son to' ninjas jodiendo con el sensei. No creo que puedan, estoy arriba 'e la vereda, ey. Cuando y donde quieras, flow que agarra y pega. Soy el estratega, esta rima es maestra y por eso llega. Por eso mi rap te defenestra, haciendo todo lo que quiera, ah. Siempre estoy tranquilo, siempre estoy fresco. Haciendo flow en el vinilo, me lo merezco. Cuando más me buscan, mi flow, desaparezco. Así que solamente, ey, yo permanezco. En la cultura, hace unos años. Por eso es que ahora quiero dejar toda' las batallas. Pero lo sigo haciendo porque solamente mi ego lo pide y toda' mis agalla'. Mis rimas no fallan, puta, solamente. Me parece que vos eras la mantarraya. Yo soy un, eh—tiburón, tengo el estímulo. Aunque en un cinturón fallan. Todos estos raperos, ey, se me quedan en cero. Piensan que Trueno se traba pero. La rompe porque empieza de nuevo. Flow real, no soy un mamagüevo. Yo sé que no soy nuevo, tienen demasiados fallo'. Pa' querer ser gallo', todavía no son huevo, oh. Se me rompieron todas las gallinas. Yo lo mando directo pa' la cocina. Mi flow te mata, sé que te asesina. Soy experto en tirar rimas. Se nace todo lo que quiera, my nigga. Seguro que me odia hasta mi vecina. Por toda la música que pongo encima. Mi flow va en serio, papi, estoy hasta China. O en el Japón, no sé, no sé, my bro. A veces no modulo, a veces juro ser el mejor. De todos, pero me doy cuenta que no. Porque supero todo lo que antes ya me pasó. Soy el primero en hacer la que cazó. Todo el mundo entero cuando empecé a rapear yo. Así que no me digas \"what you want?\" y el \"¿qué pasó?\". Que lo hago muy-muy bien, mi negro, el tren se te pasó. En la ultima estación, mi negro, yo sí tengo el don. Y lo hago tranquilo porque tengo flow. Y porque lo hago en la base. Porque tengo toda clase, porque tiro los mensaje'. Porque Trueno lo hace, porque tu rap se deshace. Acelera a la primera o a la segunda. No sé en dónde está pero sé que Trueno te da una tunda. Estamo' haciendo music, sí, mi flow tiene la funda. Acá somos guacho' de calle, no te no' confundas.",
